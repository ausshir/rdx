But it's the only answer. Maybe you don't understand the answer?</p>

<p>Instead of asking "How do I eat more?", let's ask <em>"Eat More WHAT?"</em></p>

<p>So in no particular order of importance:</p>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><p>EAT MORE FOOD. Obvious Goal here. More calories than you burn.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE OFTEN. Now you eat 4-5 meals per day instead of 3 or 2. Stop eating snacks; eat big meals.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE WHEN AWAKE. Basically, use all available hours to eat. Fuck intermittent fasting during gaining.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE FATS. Are you avoiding fats trying to not get fat? Fat is fuel &amp; energy. Add oils &amp; fats to meals.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE CARBS. Afraid of "insulin-stimulated fat storage?!?" Carbs are easy. Pancakes, Waffles, Pasta.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE FRUIT/VEGETABLES. Stick with citrus fruits &amp; berries for acidity. Some green stuff every day.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE MUSH. Chewed-food takes too long. Ground beef &gt; chicken. Rice or mashed potatoes &gt; bread.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE FLAVORS. Hyper-palatable foods whet your appetite. Use more salt, more garlic and flavor sauces.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE VOLUME. Don't start with a shake; eat a large meal, <em>then</em> chase it with a shake. Stretch the stomach.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE PREDICTABLY. Don't wait for hunger. Set 4 consistent meal-times: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm etc.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE QUICKLY/SLOWLY. Chow down with purpose. Eat vigorously. When full, slow down &amp; keep nibbling.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE WATER. Push water in-between meal times. 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm etc. Drink 16-20 ounces water.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE FAMILIAR FOODS. Eat more of what you already eat, more of your favorite and easiest foods.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE SIMPLY. Just track calories and get sufficient protein. Don't obsess about macro ratios/percentages.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE CONSISTENTLY. Some days you don't feel like lifting but do anyways. Hit your food target anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE, DAILY! Not just on lifting days. Eat on recovery days, eat on rest days. It keeps your appetite up.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE LEFTOVERS. Make extra, save some in the fridge. Have food ready-to-go in there. (Meal Prep).</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE INTENTIONALLY, NOT ACCIDENTALLY. Treat it like training. Set out a plan and follow it.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE OVER TIME. Don't just stack hundreds more calories on. Increase a little bit more every week.</p></li>
<li><p>EAT MORE THANKFULLY! Always remember surplus food is a luxury, and gaining lean mass is a privilege (:</p></li>

A lot more to go!</p>

<p>I didn't take pictures of myself when I first started this journey 60 days ago. I don't think that I gained much of anything in those first two weeks anyways (due to the big learning curve).</p>

<p>Blaming genetics and metabolism, I had come to simply accept that I would be skinny for the rest of my life. There was nothing that I could do about it. As a 26 year old male, most people would guess my age to be 19. Always told to eat more. You know, the classic song and dance.</p>

<p>Around the end of April I got incredibly sick. During this time I was required to drink lots of water each day, and thus my appetite fell. After recovering, I had stepped on the scale and weighed in at 114.5. Most days my weight would fluctuate between 118-122 (which was still a horribly low weight) but this was an all time low... This was my wake up call. I googled "how to gain weight" and came across this subreddit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Started eating 3000 calories a day. Too much. Quickly lowered to 2500 and have stuck to this ever since. Currently gaining 1.5 pounds a week on average (according to HappyScale), but I feel this is ok especially considering my starting weight.</li>
<li>Hitting my daily protein intake at this weight is incredibly easy. I've been able to get the extra 10 grams (to compensate for weight gained) by simply drinking a glass of milk at night. I'm sure it will start to get harder to fill my protein each day as I increase in weight.</li>
<li>Doing a push/pull/legs split. Not a crazy routine, just a list of workouts that I feel comfortable doing. Been tracking the weight/sets/reps on my notes app to ensure I am progressing.</li>
<li>Haven't been taking any creatine yet, but I just bought some today. I plan to do some research on the best ways to dose it later tonight.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't describe how good it feels to finally learn how to gain weight. Most of you who struggled with this will know what I mean. I felt trapped in my skinny body &amp; it is extremely liberating to know that there is a clear path ahead.</p>

<p>One HUGE benefit is the absence of random pains. Ever since I started lifting, my back and ribs have stopped hurting. I was actually about to schedule a doctor visit for my rib pain (as it had been persisting for almost 5 months). After 2 weeks of working out and not malnourishing my body? Completely gone!</p>

<p>My goal is to reach 160lbs (72.5kg) by the end of this year.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I just noticed that my shoulders/ribcage are noticeably straighter in the before/after photos. I have scoliosis and have always had lopsided shoulders. I am so happy to see this!!</p>

Went from eating maybe 2000 calories a day to eating 4000 and working out 6 days a week, changed to 5 days after a few months.</p>

<p>Damn! I was really expecting to get maybe a couple comments on this, cheers everyone for your responses. I've added the following to address comments re diet and program:</p>

<p>20 years old</p>

<ul>
<li>Overindulged on protein at around 200g per day. </li>
<li>Breakfast consists of 4 egg omelette, 4-6 slices of bacon, 2 pieces of toast, and steel cut oats</li>
<li>Lunch is mostly snacking on many granola bars (nature valley + fibre one) with Tim Hortons wraps and muffins (it's what I have available on campus)</li>
<li>Dinner varies from pasta dishes, bowls of chili, full frozen pizzas, and chicken and rice</li>
<li>Post workout is a 1300 calorie shake: 500ml 2% milk, 90-100g peanut butter, half cup quick oats, scoop of protein, and some frozen fruit for good measure</li>
</ul>

<p>Workout started as a push pull legs and I've added on an arm day so it's a 4 day split with a rest day in between. </p>

<ul>
<li>Legs: back squats, hack squats, leg extension, hamstring curl, calf raises, abductors and adductors</li>
<li>Push: bench, incline, flys, tricep pushdowns, then whatever other tricep exercise i'm feeling</li>
<li>Pull: Cable row, lat pulldown, t-bar row, bicep curls, hammer curls, shrugs / face pulls</li>
<li>Arms: smith machine shoulder press, cable lateral raises, cable upright row, forearm curls, usually biceps too</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m Still very unhappy with my chest and biceps despite my bench going from 45lbs to 205lbs but it’s a work in progress. Some of you probably remember the progress post I made when I was 130 but I feel like I’ve made the most progress since then. I’m not done with this bulk at all and I plan on going until I’m roughly 175lbs or so.</p>
